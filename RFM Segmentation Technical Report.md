# Project Background
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) features. The data will be filtered down to only users who left reviews with verified purchases in 2022-2023, the most recently available time period in the data. 

## Project Limitations
- **Volunteer bias**: Not all customers leave reviews; analysis reflects only engaged, reviewing customers.
- **Frequency calculation**: Does not account for multiple quantities per purchase.
- **Subset of reviewers**: Reviews are left by users and those who haven't made a verified purchase may not have bought the item being reviewed.
    - **Mitigation** Only verified reviewers are included, ensuring that only verified customers are selected from users. Analysis focuses on this engaged subset.
- **Review timing**: Reviews aren’t necessarily left at the time of purchase.
    - **Mitigation**: Used review dates from verified customers as a proxy for purchase dates to compute recency.
- **Monetary value estimation**: Prices of reviewed products may not reflect actual amounts paid due to discounts or price changes.
    - **Mitigation**: Used product prices at the time of scraping as a proxy for spending.
- **Missing purchase info**: Data lacks actual purchase amounts and dates.
    - **Mitigation**: Review dates and product prices serve as proxies to approximate recency, frequency, and monetary features for RFM analysis.

# Data Cleaning
- Converted missing value strings such as 'none' and 'n/a' into null values.
- Dropped duplicates.
- Filtered data to last 2 years of observations (2022 and 2023) and only reviews with verified purchases.
- Removed incorrect observations and unnecessary columns.
- Converted data types to proper format such as timestamp to seconds and price to double type (a type of integer in PySpark).

# RFM Customer Segmentation

## RFM Features
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis is a method commonly used in marketing and analytics to segment or analyze customers. RFM will be computed as features and used for customer segmentation in this project.
Traditionally, the features represent the following:

- **Recency**: how recent a customer made a purchase.
    
- **Frequency**: how often a customer makes purchases.

- **Monetary**: how much a customer spends.

The RFM features will represent the following in this project:
- **Recency**: how recent the review left by the customer is. 
    
- **Frequency**: how often a customer leaves reviews.

- **Monetary**: how much a customer spends based on prices of the product they reviewed.

## Data Preprocessing
- The data is filtered further to a 1 year range between 9/13/2022 to 9/13/2023 based on the date of the most recent review in the data.
- Applied a log transformation on skewed features.
- Scaled the data using Standard Scaler.

## Scoring
- RFM Scores are computed using window functions to rank customers for each metric.
- The invididual scores for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary are then concatenated into a single combined RFM score that summarizes each customer's behavior. For example, if a customer had a recency of 1, frequency of 2, and monetary of 3, their RFM score would be 123.

## Mapping
The customers are mapped to the following groups based on their combined RFM scores:
- **Champions**: These are the best customers, with the most recent and frequent purchases and with the most dollar spendings.
- **Loyal Customers**: Customers who have made some less recent purchases and spend a little less than champions. But these customers have still made very recent and frequent purchases with sizeable spendings.
- **Potential Loyalists**: Customers who made recent purchases, but spent moderate amounts with moderate frequncy.
- **New customers**: Customers who made the most recent purchases, but have minimal frequency and spending.
- **Promising**: Customers who made very recent purchases but have spent have low frequency and spending.
- **About To Sleep**: Customers who have moderate spending but haven't made recent or frequenct purchases.
- **Hibernating**: Customers who haven't made a purchase in while and have spent infrequently and little. They have probably churned.
- **Can't Lose Them**: Customers who haven't made recent purchases but have previously made frequent purchases with high spendings.
- **At Risk**: Customers who haven't made recent purchases but have lower spendings and frequent purchases than those under Can't Lose Them.
- **Needs Attention**: Customers who have moderate frequency and spending, but it's been a while since they made a new purchase.
- **Lost**: Customers who have churned.

# Visualization and Analysis
## RFM Segment Counts
![RFM Customer Segment Distribution](<Visuals/RFM%20Customer%20Counts.png>)

- The segments with the most customers are the **About to Sleep** and **Hibernating** segments, which is bad since these customers are at risk of churn or have churned already. About to Sleep customers haven't churned yet though and may be retained through business strategy.
- The segments with the fewest customers are the **Can't Lose Them** and **At Risk** segments. This is good since a business would want those segments to be least populated.
- There don't appear to be any **New Customers** in the data. This is one of the limitations of using user reviews instead of actual customer purchase information.

## RFM Segment Pie
![RFM Segments](<Visuals/RFM%20Segments.png>)

- 36% of customers are regular or high value customers (**Champions**, **Loyalists**, and **Potential Loyalists**)
- 33% of customers are at risk of churn but haven't churned yet (**About to Sleep**, **At Risk**, **Can't Lose Them**, and **Needs Attention**).
- 30% of customers have already churned (**Lost** and **Hibernating**).

---

## Average Monetary Value by Segment
![Average Monetary Value](<Visuals/Average%20Monetary%20Value.png>)

- Based on average Monetary value, customers in the **Can't Lose Them** and **About to Sleep** categories are high value customers that should be targeted for retention.
- **Hibernating**, **Needs Attention**, and **At Risk** customers have the lowest average Monetary value.

---

## Total Monetary Value by Segment
![Total Monetary Value](<Visuals/Total%20Monetary%20Value.png>)
- Based on total Monetary value, customers in the **Champions** and **About to Sleep** segments contain the highest value customers.
- **Hibernating**, **Needs Attention**, and **At Risk** customers have the lowest total Monetary value.
- **Can't Lose Them** customers are notable since they have the highest average monetary value but lower total monetary value. This could mean that these customers have few members in the segment, but have high spending per member. This segment has very high value and measures should be taken to retain them.
